# WebIfcFix

- create pipelines for editing IFC files in the browser, without installing any software.
- edit IFC file locally, the site doesn't have backend, all you do on the network is download a web assembly app, and your data is never sent elsewhere.
- share useful pipeline (workflow) with colleagues or the whole community with a link.
